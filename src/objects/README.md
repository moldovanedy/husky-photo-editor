# src/objects folder

This folder contains the code that will represent the object graph of the editor

## Object graph

In the object graph, every image, graphical element, text etc. will be stored toghether with the coordinates, transform (translate, rotate, scale) in order to make editing easier by being able to select an element with the pointer (mouse, finger) in the select mode.

**NOTE:** This feature is not planned in the near future because there are other more important features that need to be implemented in order to make the editor actually useful.
